pandoc freePressâ„¢_-_Google_Edition.493.3162.02704.bce793ca02283c4b75a261de58c2757c.docx -t plain -o out.txt

next remove newlines for a single line 

perl -p -i -e 's/\R//g;' filename

GNU nano 8.2 is used for wordcount in filename

from help:

press Meta(ALT)+D to Count the number of lines, words, and characters

[ 1 line,  422 words,  3155 characters ]

Then simply append that to the filename freePress.1.422.3155

Now notice the command file gives a different count- less one.

~/freePress $ file freePress.1.422.3155.txt
freePress.1.422.3155.txt: Unicode text, UTF-8 text, with very long lines (3154), with no line terminators

This may be because of a file terminator or trailing whitespace implied by nano. This needs to be figured out.
